# weather-kiosk_frontend
This is the frontend bit to the weather-kiosk_Backend. This consumes the data from the API created by the backend. My initial intent for this is to be run on a retired Android phone and set on a desk to be a weather display. It is in it's early stages and I am doing a lot of work on it.

Currently when the app starts for
the first time a setup page will open to put in the server and port number. The secondary urls can be changed as well but they are auto populated with the current ones from the backend code.

## Prerequisites
Requieres:  Flutter, "provider" module, "http" module, "intl" module, This also requires the [weather-kiosk_Backend](https://github.com/outlaws42/weather-kiosk_backend) to be running on the local network or over the internet to serve up the data needed.
