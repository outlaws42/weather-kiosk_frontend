# weather-kiosk_frontend
This is the frontend bit to the weather-kiosk_Backend. This consumes the data from theAPI created by the backend. My initial intent for this is to be run on a retired Android phone and set on a desk to be a weather display. It is in it's early stages and am doing a lot of work on it.

# Prerequisites
Requieres:  Flutter, "provider" module, "http" module, "intl" module, This also requires the [weather-kiosk_Backend](https://github.com/outlaws42/weather-kiosk_backend) to be running on the local network to serve up the data needed.
